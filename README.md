<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="skill-progression" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7268b0e-f89b-4823-b60f-76226a1a0915" />

**Adaptive Feedback Based on Photo Quality**

Photography Coach AI detects your current skill level from each individual photo and adapts its coaching:

**Beginner Level** (Photos scoring < 5.5/10 average)
- Focus on fundamentals: Rule of thirds, exposure, composition basics
- Encouragement-focused feedback
- Actionable, step-by-step guidance

**Intermediate Level** (Photos scoring 5.5-7.5/10 average)
- Explore nuanced techniques: Leading lines, fill light, color theory
- Balance confidence-building with advanced concepts
- Reference photography principles and industry standards

**Advanced Level** (Photos scoring ≥ 7.5/10 average)
- Push creative boundaries: Mood, storytelling, signature style
- Technical precision expected
- Challenge assumptions and explore artistic choices

**How It Works**

Each photo analysis:
1. Calculates average score across 5 dimensions (composition, lighting, creativity, technique, subject impact)
2. Compares to thresholds (5.5 and 7.5) to detect current skill level
3. Generates personalized "Next Skills to Master" recommendations
4. Adapts mentor chat responses based on detected level

**Why This Approach**

Unlike systems that require 20+ photos to track progression, this app gives **immediate adaptive feedback** on any single photo. A beginner's landscape might score 4/10 (triggering beginner coaching), while their portrait might score 8/10 (triggering advanced coaching)—and the system adjusts accordingly.

**Learning Outcome**

This demonstrates that skill detection doesn't require historical tracking. Gemini's vision analysis is sophisticated enough to infer skill level from the photo quality itself, enabling real-time personalization in a single-session app.

### 💬 Mentor Chat (5-Turn Conversation)

<img width="2176" height="1952" alt="mentor-chat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e03a85-e2c5-4eae-a4cb-e75eb46f56bf" />


**Beyond Single-Shot Analysis**
Most AI tools give you one answer and move on. Photography Coach AI lets you have a real conversation.

**What You Can Do:**
- **Ask clarifying questions:** "But what if I'm shooting in low light?"
- **Request comparisons:** "How does this compare to my last photo?"
- **Discuss trade-offs:** "Is f/4 acceptable if I have a tripod?"
- **Learn principles:** "Why is the rule of thirds important?"
- **Generate improvements:** "Show me what this would look like improved"

**How It Works:**
1. Upload photo and get initial 5-dimension analysis
2. Open Mentor Chat tab
3. Ask your first question (AI remembers your analysis)
4. Get instant, context-aware response
5. Ask follow-ups (up to 5 turns total)
6. Generate improved versions based on feedback

**Why It Matters:**
Photography is contextual. A horizon tilt is bad in landscapes but creative in portraits. A mentor chat lets you explore nuance—exactly what you can't get from static feedback or tutorials.

**Free Tier:** 5 turns per session
**Upgrade:** Unlimited turns for continued learning

### 🧠 Transparent Reasoning: Gemini 3 Pro's Thinking Process
<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="reasoning-process" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5e7c4988-58d4-4e8d-a924-43aa7ef3d21d" />


**Beyond Scores: See the AI's Work**

Most AI analysis tools give you results. Photography Coach AI shows you *how* the AI thinks.

**What You Get:**

When you upload a photo, Gemini 3 Pro doesn't just output scores—it exposes its complete reasoning process:

**1. Observations**
The AI's initial visual scan of your photo, noting composition, lighting, and quality immediately visible. No opinions yet—just what it saw first.

**2. Reasoning Steps**
Step-by-step evaluation against photography principles (rule of thirds, lighting theory, technical guidelines, etc.). This is the "why" behind every critique.

**3. Priority Fixes**
Ranked improvements ordered by impact:
- **Critical** – Major errors that significantly hurt the photo
- **Moderate** – Noticeable distractions or missed opportunities
- **Minor** – Polish details that refine an already-good photo

**How It Works:**

```
Upload Photo (0ms)
    ↓
Frontend Processing (100ms)
    ↓
Send to Gemini API (200ms)
    ↓
Gemini Analyzes with Extended Thinking (2-3 seconds)
    ├─ Stream 1: Observations (What did I notice?)
    ├─ Stream 2: Reasoning Steps (Why did I notice that?)
    └─ Stream 3: Priority Fixes (How should this be fixed?)
    ↓
Parse JSON Response (50ms)
    ↓
Render All 5 Tabs (instant)
```

**Why This Matters:**

Photography coaching is about understanding *why* something works or doesn't work. By exposing Gemini's reasoning, you learn not just what to fix, but the *principles* behind the feedback.

Instead of: "Your horizon is crooked" (feedback only)  
You get: "Your horizon is 3° tilted clockwise, creating tension. Straightening it using your camera's grid overlay would improve stability and follow the rule of thirds." (feedback + principle + actionable method)

**In the Detailed Analysis Tab:**

Click the "Detailed Analysis" tab in the dashboard to expand the complete thinking process. You'll see:
- Observations formatted as bullet points
- Reasoning steps as numbered logical progression
- Priority fixes ranked by impact with visual severity indicators
- Technical deep dive into composition, lighting, and technique
- Spatial issues marked on your photo with bounding boxes

**The Learning Outcome:**

This transparency teaches you photography principles in context. Rather than memorizing rules, you see how a professional AI applies them to *your* specific photo—accelerating your learning curve dramatically.

**Technical Note:**

Gemini 3 Pro's extended thinking feature captures the AI's internal reasoning at inference time. Photography Coach AI extracts and structures this thinking into observations, reasoning steps, and priority fixes—making the usually-hidden AI decision-making process visible and educational.

### 🎛 AI Enhancement: From Feedback to Improved Photo
<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="before-after" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b4b451d0-f11b-48dc-9ae7-4d383bc46388" />

**Not just “make it better” — apply specific fixes.**

Most AI image tools are black boxes: you ask for “better lighting” and hope for the best. Photography Coach AI takes a different path by tying **image generation directly to the structured critique**.

**How it works:**

1. **Analyze first.**
   Gemini 3 Pro analyzes your original photo and produces:
   - 5 dimension scores (Composition, Lighting, Creativity, Technique, Subject Impact)
   - A list of strengths and improvement opportunities
   - A structured `improvements[]` list with concrete edits (for example: “lift shadows on subject”, “reduce highlight clipping in the sky”, “remove background distraction on the right edge”).

2. **Extract targeted improvements.**
   The app takes the top improvements from the analysis and builds a precise instruction set for the image model, rather than vague prompts. This keeps the subject and framing intact while focusing on technical and aesthetic fixes.

3. **Call Gemini 3 Pro Image Generation.**
   The original photo (base64) plus the `improvements[]` list are sent to the image model. The model returns a corrected image that:
   - Preserves the original subject and composition.
   - Adjusts exposure, contrast, and color balance.
   - Optionally cleans up small distractions in the frame.

4. **Blend and compare interactively.**
   In the **AI Enhancement** tab:
   - A slider lets you blend between the original and AI-corrected image.
   - Labels clearly indicate “Original” and “AI-Corrected”.
   - You can download the improved version if you like the result.

**Why this matters for learning:**

Instead of a magic “enhance” button, you see the full chain:

> Critique → Structured improvements → Image generation → Visual

## 💡 Economics Simulation: Understanding LLM Costs

### What's Real vs. Projected

**Real Costs (What You Pay Today)**
- Single photo: $0.00204
- 10 photos: $0.0204  
- 100 photos: $0.204
- 1,000 photos: $2.04

These are actual Gemini 3 Pro charges. No caching discount applied because:
- Your requests are ~5,000 tokens each
- Gemini requires 32,768+ tokens minimum to activate caching
- Below that threshold, you pay full price

**Projected Costs (Educational Simulation)**
If this app ran at true enterprise scale with properly cached photography principles:
- 1,000 photos: $1.75 (vs $2.04 without caching)
- Savings: $0.29 per 1,000 photos (14% reduction)

This projection shows the *potential* of context caching, not actual current savings.

### Why This Matters for Learning

This project teaches three key LLM economics concepts:

1. **Token Arithmetic** - Real pricing is per million tokens, creating mathematical opportunities
2. **Cache Thresholds** - Features only activate at specific scale (32KB+ prefix requirement)
3. **Scale Economics** - Optimization only matters when request volume justifies the infrastructure

### The Honest Comparison

| Metric | Reality | Projection |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **What's Activated** | None (too small) | Cache (hypothetical) |
| **Why?** | Single-request app | Enterprise-scale app |
| **Cost per 1000 photos** | $2.04 | $1.75 |
| **Savings** | $0 (not applicable yet) | $0.29 (theoretical) |
| **What This Teaches** | Real Gemini pricing | How caching *would* help at scale |
