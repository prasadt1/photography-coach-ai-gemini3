## 🎯 What It Does

Upload any photo and get **personalized, transparent AI coaching** that:

✅ **Multi-Dimensional Analysis** – 5 independent scores (Composition, Lighting, Technique, Creative Impact, Subject Impact)
✅ **Spatial Critique** – Pinpointed flaws with severity levels (critical/moderate/minor) marked on your photo
✅ **Transparent Reasoning** – See exactly HOW the AI analyzed your photo (observations → reasoning → priority fixes)
✅ **Interactive Mentorship** – Ask follow-up questions; Gemini responds with full reasoning
✅ **Real-Time Image Generation** – Apply suggested fixes to your photo; see before/after comparison
✅ **Skill-Based Learning Path** – Get personalized "Next Skills to Master" recommendations
✅ **Production Economics** – Understand cost optimization at scale (context caching reduces costs by 75%)

**No generic templates.** Every response is dynamically generated by **Gemini 3 Pro** based on YOUR photo and YOUR questions.

```

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Context Caching** – Static photography principles cached as 32KB+ prefix, reducing per-request token cost by ~90%
2. **Structured Outputs** – All responses enforce JSON schema for reliable parsing
3. **Thinking Exposure** – Reasoning process extracted as separate field, making AI logic transparent
4. **Spatial Annotations** – Bounding boxes mark FLAWS only (not strengths), teaching through error correction
5. **Full-Stack Integration** – Frontend handles all UI, backend is pure Gemini APIs (no custom servers)

AI: "Great question! Looking at your photo, you have some strong elements but opportunity in framing.
Here's what I observe: [observations]. My reasoning: [steps]. Priority fix: [suggestion]"

User: "Should I use a wider angle lens?"

AI: "Absolutely! At your current focal length (35mm equivalent), a wider lens would:
[detailed response with reasoning about DOF, framing, perspective distortion, etc.]"
