## 🎯 What It Does

Upload any photo and get **personalized, transparent AI coaching** that:

✅ **Multi-Dimensional Analysis** – 5 independent scores (Composition, Lighting, Technique, Creative Impact, Subject Impact)
✅ **Spatial Critique** – Pinpointed flaws with severity levels (critical/moderate/minor) marked on your photo
✅ **Transparent Reasoning** – See exactly HOW the AI analyzed your photo (observations → reasoning → priority fixes)
✅ **Interactive Mentorship** – Ask follow-up questions; Gemini responds with full reasoning
✅ **Real-Time Image Generation** – Apply suggested fixes to your photo; see before/after comparison
✅ **Skill-Based Learning Path** – Get personalized "Next Skills to Master" recommendations
✅ **Production Economics** – Understand cost optimization at scale (context caching reduces costs by 75%)

**No generic templates.** Every response is dynamically generated by **Gemini 3 Pro** based on YOUR photo and YOUR questions.

<img width="1024" height="1024" alt="skill-progression" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a7268b0e-f89b-4823-b60f-76226a1a0915" />

**Adaptive Feedback Based on Photo Quality**

Photography Coach AI detects your current skill level from each individual photo and adapts its coaching:

**Beginner Level** (Photos scoring < 5.5/10 average)
- Focus on fundamentals: Rule of thirds, exposure, composition basics
- Encouragement-focused feedback
- Actionable, step-by-step guidance

**Intermediate Level** (Photos scoring 5.5-7.5/10 average)
- Explore nuanced techniques: Leading lines, fill light, color theory
- Balance confidence-building with advanced concepts
- Reference photography principles and industry standards

**Advanced Level** (Photos scoring ≥ 7.5/10 average)
- Push creative boundaries: Mood, storytelling, signature style
- Technical precision expected
- Challenge assumptions and explore artistic choices

**How It Works**

Each photo analysis:
1. Calculates average score across 5 dimensions (composition, lighting, creativity, technique, subject impact)
2. Compares to thresholds (5.5 and 7.5) to detect current skill level
3. Generates personalized "Next Skills to Master" recommendations
4. Adapts mentor chat responses based on detected level

**Why This Approach**

Unlike systems that require 20+ photos to track progression, this app gives **immediate adaptive feedback** on any single photo. A beginner's landscape might score 4/10 (triggering beginner coaching), while their portrait might score 8/10 (triggering advanced coaching)—and the system adjusts accordingly.

**Learning Outcome**

This demonstrates that skill detection doesn't require historical tracking. Gemini's vision analysis is sophisticated enough to infer skill level from the photo quality itself, enabling real-time personalization in a single-session app.

### 💬 Mentor Chat (5-Turn Conversation)

<img width="2176" height="1952" alt="mentor-chat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/63e03a85-e2c5-4eae-a4cb-e75eb46f56bf" />


**Beyond Single-Shot Analysis**
Most AI tools give you one answer and move on. Photography Coach AI lets you have a real conversation.

**What You Can Do:**
- **Ask clarifying questions:** "But what if I'm shooting in low light?"
- **Request comparisons:** "How does this compare to my last photo?"
- **Discuss trade-offs:** "Is f/4 acceptable if I have a tripod?"
- **Learn principles:** "Why is the rule of thirds important?"
- **Generate improvements:** "Show me what this would look like improved"

**How It Works:**
1. Upload photo and get initial 5-dimension analysis
2. Open Mentor Chat tab
3. Ask your first question (AI remembers your analysis)
4. Get instant, context-aware response
5. Ask follow-ups (up to 5 turns total)
6. Generate improved versions based on feedback

**Why It Matters:**
Photography is contextual. A horizon tilt is bad in landscapes but creative in portraits. A mentor chat lets you explore nuance—exactly what you can't get from static feedback or tutorials.

**Free Tier:** 5 turns per session
**Upgrade:** Unlimited turns for continued learning

## 🏗️ Architecture

<img width="2528" height="1696" alt="arch-main" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/60b269f1-f1e4-4eb6-b720-00015b2fc7b5" />

The app is built with:
- **Frontend:** React + TypeScript with a beautiful 5-tab dashboard
- **AI Engine:** Google Gemini 3 Pro (Vision + Image Generation + Chat)
- **Speed:** 2.5 seconds from upload to analysis
- **Scale:** Context caching reduces costs by 90% at enterprise scale

What you get:
- **5 Dimension Scores** - Composition, Lighting, Creativity, Technique, Subject Impact
- **Spatial Feedback** - Bounding boxes marking specific issues in your photo
- **Mentor Chat** - Ask follow-up questions, get personalized guidance
- **AI Enhancement** - Generate improved versions of your photo
- **Cost Transparency** - See exactly how much each analysis costs


**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **Context Caching** – Static photography principles cached as 32KB+ prefix, reducing per-request token cost by ~90%
2. **Structured Outputs** – All responses enforce JSON schema for reliable parsing
3. **Thinking Exposure** – Reasoning process extracted as separate field, making AI logic transparent
4. **Spatial Annotations** – Bounding boxes mark FLAWS only (not strengths), teaching through error correction
5. **Full-Stack Integration** – Frontend handles all UI, backend is pure Gemini APIs (no custom servers)

## 💡 Economics Simulation: Understanding LLM Costs

### What's Real vs. Projected

**Real Costs (What You Pay Today)**
- Single photo: $0.00204
- 10 photos: $0.0204  
- 100 photos: $0.204
- 1,000 photos: $2.04

These are actual Gemini 3 Pro charges. No caching discount applied because:
- Your requests are ~5,000 tokens each
- Gemini requires 32,768+ tokens minimum to activate caching
- Below that threshold, you pay full price

**Projected Costs (Educational Simulation)**
If this app ran at true enterprise scale with properly cached photography principles:
- 1,000 photos: $1.75 (vs $2.04 without caching)
- Savings: $0.29 per 1,000 photos (14% reduction)

This projection shows the *potential* of context caching, not actual current savings.

### Why This Matters for Learning

This project teaches three key LLM economics concepts:

1. **Token Arithmetic** - Real pricing is per million tokens, creating mathematical opportunities
2. **Cache Thresholds** - Features only activate at specific scale (32KB+ prefix requirement)
3. **Scale Economics** - Optimization only matters when request volume justifies the infrastructure

### The Honest Comparison

| Metric | Reality | Projection |
|--------|---------|-----------|
| **What's Activated** | None (too small) | Cache (hypothetical) |
| **Why?** | Single-request app | Enterprise-scale app |
| **Cost per 1000 photos** | $2.04 | $1.75 |
| **Savings** | $0 (not applicable yet) | $0.29 (theoretical) |
| **What This Teaches** | Real Gemini pricing | How caching *would* help at scale |
